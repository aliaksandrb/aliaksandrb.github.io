<section class='post-content'><p>At the middle of November our small team have participated in the <a href="https://railsrumble.com/">RailsRumble</a>
hackathon.</p>

<p>Despite we haven&rsquo;t took any prize we were satisfied by the process itself and
had some fun during it.</p>

<p>And after a certain time, I want to share my thoughts about how it was generally
and what lessons I have learned from that participation.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Short intro about hackathons</h3>

<p>For those who are not familiar with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a> format: it is a geek event
where for a limited time you as individual or as part of a team suppose to
provide the working prototype of your idea. It could be everything, from a
web-application or mobile app to a handcrafted robot, just depends on the topic
and the rules of the specific hackathon.</p>

<p>Various people, time pressure, continuous concentration on a project, general
excitement - just a few of many other factors that make hackathons full of fun
and challenges.</p>

<p>What differs the <a href="https://railsrumble.com/">RailsRumble</a> from the others hackathons is its
restrictions list. Let me just leave an quote from their website here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rails Rumble is a distributed programming competition where hundreds of
teams of one to four people, from all over the world, have 48 hours to build
an innovative web application, with Ruby on Rails, or another Rack-based Ruby
web framework, along with other web technologies. Use Ruby for your entire
stack, or just the backend.</p>

<p>After the 48 hours are up, everyone picks their favorites and the top ten
winners are revealed!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that it is enough for understanding format of the event.</p>

<h3>How it was</h3>

<p>It is good to notice, that actually it was the first online hackathon for us,
and that it is slightly different than typical local one, when each participant
team stays in one place all together for the whole time period.</p>

<p>We have decided to stay at our working office rather than at someone private
place because of a such criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is empty on weekends, so nobody could disturb us</li>
<li>we could stay there for the whole night long</li>
<li>such facilities as high-speed Internet, whiteboard and space for everybody are
already provided, so we no need to spend a time on such things</li>
<li>I have much powerful workstation here than at home :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of time-zones difference we have decided to start not at exact beginning
(2 AM our time) but at morning, near 6 AM and stay until the end,
44 hours later.</p>

<p>Some food was bought before, the rest we have ordered online after.</p>

<p>Next picture shows my unhealthy &ldquo;starter kit&rdquo; from the first day:
<img title="Almost no healthy food here :p" alt="Hackathon starter kit" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/aliaksandrb/image/upload/v1448733270/food_pack.jpg" /></p>

<p>For the whole period we have coded, talked, discussed things, spent time on the
kitchen, and so on.</p>

<p>The luckiest are even had a time to sleep, but I personally  haven&rsquo;t came in
that list and have slept only for 3 hours only x_x.</p>

<p>Long story short, here is the short time-lapse recap movie, hope it give some
overview:</p>

<h3>What have we done right</h3>

<p>Here is short list of the steps done that helped us to successfully participate
up to finish line:</p>

<h6>Idea brainstorming</h6>

<p>Okay, that is clear. If you have no idea before event start the chances that you
would get one are pretty small. Believe me or not, but it take a lot of time
to get an at least something that satisfies every member and at least worth to
get hands dirty.</p>

<p>We have met a few times week before the actual start to share our thoughts and
ideas with an aim to select the main one.</p>

<h6>Preliminary planning</h6>

<p>I think that it is the second step that you should do.</p>

<p>According to the rules you can not commit any code until the event starts.
But you could and should plan how you would implement your idea, who would be
responsible for which part project and so on.</p>

<p>Of course you no need to plan every minor point, but even generic map of
required actions, technological stack chosen and responsibilities would affect
your participation in a positive way. You would save a lot of time by this.</p>

<p>We have used <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a> for it.</p>

<h6>Disturbing things and facilities</h6>

<p>As it was mentioned before, you don&rsquo;t need to spend your limited time on things
that are not project related. So it always better to think about it before.</p>

<h6>Take a rest</h6>

<p>It always good to be prepared not only technically but physically too.</p>

<p>A few hours late might not be a big deal if you start full of energy in contrast
the situation when you start earlier but feel sleepy from the beginning.</p>

<hr>

<p>The sad story that it&rsquo;s the end of the list already.
So maybe it&rsquo;s the actual reason of our fail. :)</p>

<p>Here is the opposite one.</p>

<h3>What have we done wrong</h3>

<p>The list of fails and notices to have in mind for a next time.</p>

<h6>Check the feasibility of the main idea</h6>

<p>The biggest fail that have caught us from the beginning.</p>

<p>Our idea have looked <em>achievable</em>, some useful libraries were found but
we haven&rsquo;t checked the dependency on 3rd-party services. Yay!</p>

<p>At the beginning we have thought about internal usage of the various search
engines such as <code>Google</code>, <code>Bing</code>, <code>Yandex</code> and so on.</p>

<p>But the problem we haven&rsquo;t checked have related to the limits of its usage.</p>

<p><strong>And all of them are pretty small!</strong></p>

<p>By <strong>small</strong> I mean the numbers like <strong>1000 requests per month</strong> and less.
And that is not enough for testing, active development and future usage by other
people at least for time of judging.</p>

<p>We have spent some time trying to find an easy ways to overcome those limits but
without success.</p>

<p>Of course there are some methods, like switching between precreated accounts,
proxy usage and so on, but we have decided that it would just wrong to base
the main functionality trying to overplay a big corporations.</p>

<p>Because of this we have switched to another, much more simplified idea,
just to not leave the distance of the hackathon.</p>

<p>Moral: <strong>Check it twice before start or at least have a good plan B.</strong></p>

<h6>Environment setup</h6>

<p>The same story every time.. We have discussed the technological stack and
libraries versions, but doesn&rsquo;t prepared setup on local machines.</p>

<p>So at least an hour was spent only on basic installations and problem solving
for three different computers.</p>

<p><strong>It would be beneficial to have an environment ready for everybody.</strong></p>

<p>I prefer [Vagrant] for this, so next time we definitely should start just by
running <code>vagrant up</code> on the precreated <code>Vagrantfile</code>.</p>

<h6>Reimplementing the wheel</h6>

<p>For a custom project it might be applicable to create some specific solutions
for common things. But it definitely not worth to do it when you limited by
time.</p>

<p><strong>Simplify as much as possible. Try to reuse existent libraries and solutions.</strong></p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s <code>Rails</code> then use an existent gems, if it&rsquo;s <code>Javascript</code> -
<code>jquery-plugins</code>, <code>npm</code> packages or any other framework libraries, dependent
on what you are using.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t spend a time on writing something from scratch until you really
need to.</strong> It error prone and time consuming. And generally useless because
almost always you will never use same codebase after even if you will decide to
support a project after the competition.</p>

<h6>Share roles and do what you are better in</h6>

<p>My recent tasks at work are related to backends. But almost 70% of hackathon
time I have spent on frontend, just because nobody else could/want to do it.</p>

<p>Of course sometimes it is fun to learn new/refresh forgotten skills,
but if you have a chance - <strong>try to find a proper person in your team who will
fill these gaps better.</strong> It all about balanced team.</p>

<p>I believe that if we have a frontend developer (our team have consisted on
two backends and one designer) we would achieve and got done dramatically more.</p>

<p>At the same time I have learned the different types of web-animations, specially
the <code>CSS</code> and <code>Javascript</code> based ones.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know where to use that skill though :J</p>

<h6>Think about UI &amp; design</h6>

<p>The practice shows that even not rocket-science project could be warmly welcomed
by audience if it looks good and haven&rsquo;t leave the feeling of <em>incompleteness</em>.
But even high-tech project with raw blank page layout and blue links on it
hasn&rsquo;t so many chances to be even tested by people, just because it seems
broken in such case.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sad but true. From over <code>250 projects</code> have participated in <a href="https://railsrumble.com/">RailsRumble</a>,
for my opinion near a half looked broken, and some of them actually was.</p>

<p>Usually at local hackathons only near 30 projects presented at final stage. But
online format allows much wider amount of participants.</p>

<p><strong>So you can&rsquo;t get positive feedback if people even can&rsquo;t try claimed
functionality. Or if it looks so bad that they just wouldn&rsquo;t to.</strong></p>

<h6>Concentrate on the main things</h6>

<p>All the cool features could be added at the next iteration if you have a time.</p>

<p>Just take you main idea, make it work and be satisfied with it. Only when you
already have something to show check what could be improved or added.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t try to do everything at once, there is a big chance that you will
finish with nothing.</strong></p>

<p>The working prototype is better that a none-working full-feature project.</p>

<h6>Spend time on testing</h6>

<p>On the hackathon there is big chance that you will skip all the tests :)
<strong>But you should check at least manually that main flow is working, there is no
obvious bugs and so on.</strong></p>

<p>We have spent a half an hour together checking a project before final countdown.
During that time several bugs were found, but despite that we have fixed them,
at least the one actually come to production and was found after code the
freeze.</p>

<p>Luckily nobody have used it and we have had a time to provide a hack next day.
<em>(As commits was forbidden and [Heroku] boxes are read-only, the hack was based
on a <code>cron</code> job that periodically makes some changes on remote server using its
console add-on.)</em></p>

<h6>Restrict access but leave the guest login and respect people privacy</h6>

<p>This point depends on the type of your application. In some cases if you don&rsquo;t
want your application to be <em>broken</em> in a fist minutes of public access try to
restrict it to logged in users or hide the dangerous endpoints at all.</p>

<p>Here by <em>broken</em> I mean not only totally crashed application but also the empty
one, in cases when you need some precreated data being shown to users, but
unfortunately being deleted by someone.</p>

<p>At the same time registration should be easy (you can just prepare guest
account) and don&rsquo;t ask more permissions than you really need to.
I have seen a lot of projects that requires full access to read &amp; write on
<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, including private repositories. It is clear that only people with
an empty accounts would try such service during the judgment period.</p>

<p>Thats all!</p>

<p>Additionally, you can find a few more worthy tips specially on how to improve
the score judges will give your app in <a href="(http://kernowsoul.com/blog/2013/10/16/how-to-rumble-like-a-boss/)">this blog-post</a> by Jamie Dyer, who was
both a competitor and an expert judge in the Rails Rumble some years ago.
I have found it useful, but sadly only after participation :(</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Each hackathon is different. Some looks like a competition, some aren&rsquo;t.
Despite of its format it&rsquo;s up to you to find a reason for participation. And
based on that you might not take the notices above to seriously.</p>

<p>In any case you would have a nice time with a various people on a same
mental wave with you, discover new technologies, try yourself in a new roles,
share skills, listen for interesting mentors and much more..</p>

<p>Networking, pizza and beer (juice) could be also the reason to participate. :)</p>

<p>So you will never regret despite the result. <strong>See you at hackathons!</strong>

<p><em><strong>P.S</strong>. Our small laggy project made for fun is still online and could be
found <a href="http://searchfighter.r15.railsrumble.com/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>The idea is pretty simple: create a quiz, each question in which
is a fighting round. Fighting generated on server and even it looks a bit
similar (because of small amount of .png-sprites prepared) is different each
time. The animations done by css-transitions and classes that managed by the
<code>Javascript</code>. All the rest is the basic Rails application.</em></p>
