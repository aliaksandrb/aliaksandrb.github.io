    <summary type="html">At the middle of November our small team have participated in the RailsRumble
hackathon.

Despite we haven&amp;rsquo;t took any prize we were satisfied by the process itself and
had some fun during it.

And after a certain time, I want to share my thoughts about how it was generally
and what lessons I have learned from that participation.
